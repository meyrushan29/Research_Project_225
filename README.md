## Project Overview
The AI-Driven Health Analyzer is a mobile-based application designed to provide
real-time, personalized health recommendations by integrating hydration management,
fitness optimization, and mental health assessment using machine learning and
deep learning techniques.

---

## Problem Statement
Existing health applications provide generic and static recommendations.
They do not consider real-time user behavior, environmental factors, posture
correction, or emotional state, leading to potential health risks.

---

## Proposed Solution
Our system provides:
- Personalized hydration prediction using Random Forest Regression
- Lip-based hydration detection using ResNet-18
- Real-time fitness posture feedback
- Multimodal mental health assessment
- Integrated AI-driven health recommendations

---

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: Flutter
- Backend: Python, Node.js
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - ResNet-18 (CNN)
- Database: MongoDB

---

## Current Progress (PP1)
- UI prototype developed using Flutter
- Hydration prediction logic designed
- Lip-based hydration prediction integrated at prototype level
- Screen-recorded prototype demo prepared
